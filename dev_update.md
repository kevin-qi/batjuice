# Development Update - Bat Feeder Control System

## Project Overview
**Bat Feeder Control System** - A neuroscience experimental platform for controlling feeders based on bat flight patterns with real-time position tracking.

## Recent Git Commits
- `6b55fd1` - Update .gitignore to exclude Serena analysis folder
- `82a1f2f` - Add .gitattributes for consistent line endings
- `6c9a5f3` - Functional Feeder Control Software (minus rtls data stream)
- `3b99821` - Updated code with consolidated task logic
- `2657c04` - Initial app development

## Development Milestones

### 1. Initial Development (commit 2657c04)
- Established basic application structure
- Created core modules for feeder control
- Set up initial GUI framework

### 2. Task Logic Consolidation (commit 3b99821)
- Unified task logic system for better maintainability
- Improved feeder control algorithms
- Enhanced system state management
- Streamlined reward delivery logic

### 3. Functional System Implementation (commit 6c9a5f3)
Major refactoring and feature completion:

#### Architecture Improvements
- Added comprehensive documentation:
  - `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` - System design documentation
  - `README_TaskLogic.md` - Task logic implementation guide
  - `README_Ciholas_Integration.md` - Ciholas UWB integration guide

#### Position Tracking Enhancements
- **Ciholas UWB Tracker**: Significantly enhanced (+401 lines)
  - Improved real-time tracking capabilities
  - Better error handling and connection management
- **Removed Deprecated Code**: Eliminated `real_data_tracker.py` (-202 lines)
- **Mock Tracker**: Refined simulation for testing without hardware

#### Code Consolidation
- **Removed redundant modules** in favor of unified task_logic:
  - `feeder_logic/feeder_manager.py` (-325 lines)
  - `feeder_logic/position_processor.py` (-73 lines)  
  - `feeder_logic/reward_system.py` (-29 lines)
- **Streamlined data structures** (`utils/data_structures.py` reduced by 118 lines)

#### Hardware Integration
- Enhanced Arduino controller with improved error handling
- Better mock Arduino implementation for testing
- Reliable beam-break detection and motor control

## Key Components Developed

### Position Tracking System
- **Cortex MoCap**: Motion capture at 120 Hz
- **Ciholas UWB**: Ultra-wideband tracking at 100 Hz
- **Mock Tracker**: Realistic flight simulation for testing

### Hardware Control
- Arduino integration for motor control
- Beam-break sensor detection
- TTL pulse generation
- Configurable feeder parameters (duration, probability, distance)

### Task Logic Module
- Modular reward system with configurable rules
- Real-time position processing
- Distance-based activation logic
- Probability-based reward delivery

### GUI System (Tkinter-based)
- **Control Tab**: Feeder panels with real-time status and manual controls
- **Monitoring Tab**: Session information and system statistics
- **Flight Paths Tab**: 2D/3D visualization with interactive controls
- **Configuration Management**: Live parameter adjustment

### Data Logging
- Synchronized CSV logging with timestamps
- Position tracking data (`positions_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`)
- Reward delivery events (`rewards_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`)
- Event logging with detailed system state

### Mock Mode
- Full simulation environment without hardware dependencies
- 3 simulated flying bats with realistic movement
- 2 virtual feeders with beam-break detection
- Complete GUI and logging functionality

## Current System Status
- **Functional**: Core feeder control system operational
- **Pending**: RTLS (Real-Time Location System) data stream integration
- **Testing**: Mock mode fully functional for development and testing

## Technical Improvements
- Consistent line ending handling via `.gitattributes`
- Improved code organization and modularity
- Reduced code duplication through consolidation
- Enhanced error handling and system robustness

## Use Cases
The system enables neuroscience researchers to:
- Track multiple bats in real-time during flight
- Automatically deliver rewards based on configurable spatial rules
- Collect synchronized behavioral and reward data
- Test experimental protocols in simulation before live experiments
- Monitor and control experiments through intuitive GUI

## Next Steps
- Complete RTLS data stream integration
- Performance optimization for real-time tracking
- Extended testing with live hardware
- Additional task logic modules for different experimental paradigms
