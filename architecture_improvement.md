# Architecture Improvement Analysis

## Critical Assessment of Proposed Solution

### Over-Engineering Issues in code_review.md

1. **Plugin Manager Complexity**: The proposed `TaskLogicManager` with dynamic module loading via `importlib` is unnecessary. Scientists won't be installing plugins - they'll be writing simple Python functions.

2. **Abstract Base Classes**: Three abstract methods (`should_deliver_reward`, `get_configuration_schema`, `validate_configuration`) is too complex. Scientists just need to write reward logic.

3. **Configuration Schema System**: JSON schema validation is over-engineered. Scientists should focus on logic, not configuration management.

4. **Event-Based Communication**: Mentioned in Phase 3 but undefined - adds unnecessary complexity.

### Gaps in Proposed Solution

1. **No clear data contract**: What exact data does task logic receive? Current system passes entire objects.
2. **Missing utilities**: Scientists need distance calculations, they shouldn't reimplement them.
3. **No testing strategy**: How do scientists test their logic without running the entire system?
4. **Unclear boundaries**: Who manages state updates? Configuration? Logging?

## Simplified Architecture Proposal

### Core Principle: Single Responsibility
- **Scientists write**: "Should this bat get a reward now?" (Pure logic)
- **Engineers provide**: Everything else (hardware, GUI, state, logging, configuration)

### The Minimal Interface

```python
# task_logic_interface.py
from typing import NamedTuple, Optional

class BatInfo(NamedTuple):
    """Information about a bat - provided by system"""
    id: str
    position: tuple[float, float, float]  # (x, y, z) in meters
    position_age: float  # seconds since position update
    is_active: bool  # can receive rewards
    time_since_last_reward: Optional[float]  # seconds, None if never
    last_reward_feeder_id: Optional[int]

class FeederInfo(NamedTuple):
    """Information about a feeder - provided by system"""
    id: int
    position: tuple[float, float, float]  # (x, y, z) in meters
    is_available: bool  # not owned by another bat

class TriggerEvent(NamedTuple):
    """The event that triggered evaluation"""
    type: str  # "beam_break", "proximity", "timer"
    feeder_id: int
    bat_id: str
    timestamp: float

def decide_reward(bat: BatInfo, feeder: FeederInfo, event: TriggerEvent, config: dict) -> bool:
    """
    The ONLY function scientists need to implement.
    
    Returns: True if bat should get reward, False otherwise
    """
    pass
```

### Scientist's Implementation Example

```python
# task_logics/proximity_reward.py
from task_logic_interface import BatInfo, FeederInfo, TriggerEvent
from task_logic_utils import calculate_distance

def decide_reward(bat: BatInfo, feeder: FeederInfo, event: TriggerEvent, config: dict) -> bool:
    """
    Simple proximity-based reward logic.
    Bat gets reward if:
    1. It triggered a beam break
    2. It's within activation radius
    3. It's active (hasn't gotten reward recently)
    """
    # Only respond to beam breaks
    if event.type != "beam_break":
        return False
    
    # Check if bat is active
    if not bat.is_active:
        return False
    
    # Check distance
    distance = calculate_distance(bat.position, feeder.position)
    activation_radius = config.get("activation_radius", 0.5)  # meters
    
    return distance <= activation_radius
```

### Utilities Provided to Scientists

```python
# task_logic_utils.py
import math
from typing import Tuple

def calculate_distance(pos1: Tuple[float, float, float], 
                       pos2: Tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """Calculate 3D Euclidean distance between positions"""
    dx = pos1[0] - pos2[0]
    dy = pos1[1] - pos2[1]
    dz = pos1[2] - pos2[2]
    return math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz)

def calculate_2d_distance(pos1: Tuple[float, float, float], 
                          pos2: Tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """Calculate 2D distance (ignoring z-axis)"""
    dx = pos1[0] - pos2[0]
    dy = pos1[1] - pos2[1]
    return math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)

def is_position_fresh(position_age: float, max_age: float = 1.0) -> bool:
    """Check if position data is recent enough"""
    return position_age <= max_age
```

### Integration Layer (Engineers Only)

```python
# task_logic_adapter.py
import importlib
from task_logic_interface import BatInfo, FeederInfo, TriggerEvent

class TaskLogicAdapter:
    """Adapter between core system and scientist's logic"""
    
    def __init__(self, logic_module_name: str = "proximity_reward"):
        # Load the scientist's module
        module = importlib.import_module(f"task_logics.{logic_module_name}")
        self.decide_reward = module.decide_reward
        
        # Load configuration for this logic
        self.config = self._load_config(logic_module_name)
    
    def should_deliver_reward(self, system_state, feeder_id: int, bat_id: str, 
                             event_type: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
        """
        Convert system state to simple data for scientist's function.
        This is the ONLY place where system complexity meets simple logic.
        """
        # Extract simple data from complex system state
        bat_data = system_state.bats[bat_id]
        feeder_data = system_state.feeders[feeder_id]
        
        # Create simple immutable objects
        bat = BatInfo(
            id=bat_id,
            position=tuple(bat_data.last_position[:3]),
            position_age=time.time() - bat_data.last_position[3],
            is_active=(bat_data.activation_state == "ACTIVE"),
            time_since_last_reward=(time.time() - bat_data.last_reward_time 
                                   if bat_data.last_reward_time else None),
            last_reward_feeder_id=bat_data.last_reward_feeder_id
        )
        
        feeder = FeederInfo(
            id=feeder_id,
            position=tuple(feeder_data.position),
            is_available=(feeder_data.owner_bat_id in [None, bat_id])
        )
        
        event = TriggerEvent(
            type=event_type,
            feeder_id=feeder_id,
            bat_id=bat_id,
            timestamp=time.time()
        )
        
        # Call scientist's pure function
        try:
            should_reward = self.decide_reward(bat, feeder, event, self.config)
            reason = f"Task logic returned {should_reward}"
            return should_reward, reason
        except Exception as e:
            # Log error but don't crash system
            print(f"Error in task logic: {e}")
            return False, f"Task logic error: {e}"
    
    def update_state_after_reward(self, system_state, feeder_id: int, bat_id: str):
        """Handle all state updates - scientists don't deal with this"""
        # This stays in the engineering domain
        # Scientists only decide IF reward happens, not WHAT happens after
```

## Implementation Plan (Simplified)

### Phase 1: Clean Up (30 minutes)
1. Delete `/task_logic/deprecated/`
2. Remove duplicate GUI files
3. Clean `.gitignore`

### Phase 2: Create Simple Interface (1 hour)
1. Create `task_logic_interface.py` with 3 NamedTuples and 1 function signature
2. Create `task_logic_utils.py` with helper functions
3. Create `task_logics/` folder for scientist implementations

### Phase 3: Create Adapter (1 hour)
1. Create `task_logic_adapter.py` to bridge system and logic
2. Modify `feeder_controller.py` to use adapter (minimal changes)
3. Move current logic to `task_logics/standard.py`

### Phase 4: Documentation (30 minutes)
1. Create `SCIENTIST_GUIDE.md` with simple examples
2. Create test template for scientists
3. Add configuration examples

## Key Differences from Original Proposal

### Simpler
- One function to implement, not a class with 3+ methods
- No abstract base classes or inheritance
- No plugin manager or dynamic loading complexity
- No configuration schemas

### Clearer Boundaries
- Scientists: Write `decide_reward()` function only
- Engineers: Handle everything else through adapter
- Data flows one way: System → Logic → Decision

### Easier Testing
```python
# Scientists can test with simple data
def test_my_logic():
    bat = BatInfo(id="bat1", position=(1, 1, 1), ...)
    feeder = FeederInfo(id=1, position=(1, 1, 1), ...)
    event = TriggerEvent(type="beam_break", ...)
    
    assert decide_reward(bat, feeder, event, {}) == True
```

### More Maintainable
- Single adapter file contains all complexity
- Scientists' code is pure functions with no side effects
- Configuration stays in JSON files, not in code
- State management stays in engineering domain

## What Scientists Need to Know

1. **Your job**: Write a function that returns True/False for reward delivery
2. **Your inputs**: Simple data about bat, feeder, and triggering event
3. **Your tools**: Helper functions for distance calculations
4. **Not your problem**: Hardware, GUI, state updates, logging, configuration files

## What Engineers Maintain

1. **Hardware abstraction**: Arduino, sensors, motors
2. **GUI**: All visualization and controls
3. **State management**: Tracking bat states, feeder ownership
4. **Data flow**: Converting system state to simple data structures
5. **Configuration**: Loading and managing JSON files
6. **Testing infrastructure**: Mock systems for development

## Migration Path

1. **Week 1**: Implement adapter without breaking current system
2. **Week 2**: Move current logic to new structure
3. **Week 3**: Create documentation and examples
4. **Week 4**: Train scientists on new system

## Success Metrics

- Scientist can write new logic in < 30 minutes
- No need to understand core system
- Logic files are < 50 lines
- Can test logic without running full system
- Zero imports from core system in logic files

## Conclusion

The proposed plugin architecture in code_review.md is over-engineered for this use case. Scientists aren't software engineers - they need the simplest possible interface to express experimental logic. This revised proposal:

- Reduces interface to ONE function
- Provides clear, immutable data structures
- Handles all complexity in adapter layer
- Enables simple unit testing
- Maintains complete separation of concerns

This approach is maintainable because the complexity is isolated in one adapter file, while scientists work with pure, simple functions that are easy to understand, test, and modify.
